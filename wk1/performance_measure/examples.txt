Example 1

    How much longer would an n^2 algorithm take
    if the input was 5 times larger?

    T(n) = n^2

    T(5n) = ...

Example 2

    How much longer would an n^3 algorithm take
    if the input was 3 times larger?

    T(n) = n^3

    T(3n) = ...

Example 3

    Remove the lower order terms and constant factors:

    6n*log(n) + 5n + 2
    => ...

Example 4

    Remove the lower order terms and constant factors:

    2n^2 + 4n + log(n)
    => ...
